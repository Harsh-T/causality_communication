logo: docs/assets/Intro.JPG
description: The societal impact of communication motivated the establishment of communication studies. However, establishing causality within the field remains challenging, especially in technologically mediated contexts. Communication is a diverse field, and causal interpretations vary across traditions. This workshop will explore how different subfields address causality, emphasizing the need for causal explanations to enhance theory building. It will also discuss methodological approaches, challenges, and future directions for establishing causality in communication research.
