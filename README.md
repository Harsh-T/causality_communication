# Consolidating Communication Research Through Causal Inference
Blue Sky Big Ideas: Workshop Presented at ICA 2025

# Workshop Description

## Session Goals
Communication scholars are keen on understanding the cause and effects of various communication phenomena in both interpersonal and mediated contexts, and many communication theories are in fact causal. While the question of causality is not new, it has recently attracted more attention because of the unprecedented prevalence of digital trace data, which along with the availability of various publicly accessible datasets, provide unique opportunities for communication scholars to ask innovative research questions with causal inference based on observational data, yielding greater ecological validity. However, institutions have yet to incorporate these methodological advancement in their curricula. This workshop will introduce and discuss modern causal inference methods, more common in other social sciences, that can be used to determine a true cause-and-effect relationship in both quantitative and qualitative communication science. Specifically, we will focus on how communication researchers could harness causal inference thinking, designs and methods to advance their inquiries into communication phenomena. 

## Outcomes
We are a very dispersed discipline and even the definition of what is “causal” differs by communication subfield. Therefore, the goal is to learn how the different subfields of communication engage with the issue and learn from each other. We hope that the workshop will lead to a discussion about a possible special issue and a development of a more organized group of researchers interested in causality in communication science.
